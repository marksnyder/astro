# 🌌 Astro  
## Organize your Universe.

Astro is an open-source AI workspace for organizing knowledge, chatting with your documents, and coordinating with intelligent agents — all inside isolated workspaces called **Universes**.

It combines structured organization with retrieval-aware AI, so your data isn’t just stored — it’s understood.

# What Is Astro?

Astro is a centralized system for:

- Notes  
- Documents  
- Tasks  
- Links  
- AI conversations  
- Agent communication  

Everything lives inside **Universes** — cleanly separated workspaces that keep your knowledge organized and contained.

You control the system.  
You control the data.  
You decide how AI interacts with it.
